# JenkinsApp
A Mac OS X app wrapper for Jenkins.

# Design
The app is intended to be used in a way that makes Jenkins highly portable on Mac OS X. All data is contained in the app file/folder structure which helps avoid dealing with admin privileges and start/stop service scripts that you normally have to deal with using the [traditional Jenkins installer](http://mirrors.jenkins-ci.org/osx/).
